# startupdotmeta
A handler for the startup.meta file for Red Dead Redemption 2 that enables completely private lobbies. Written in C++ from scratch, only runs on Windows as it uses URLDownloadToFile instead of libcurl for the sake of simplicity. Writes to and reads from a simple binary file to maintain folder location names.
